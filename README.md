# Java Developer Internship Projects

This repository contains the Java projects completed during my 1-month internship at **Future Intern**. Each project showcases core Java programming skills, ranging from basic applications to more interactive games.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Calculator
A basic calculator that supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program features a simple command-line interface where users can input numbers and operators.

### 2. Number Guessing Game
A fun, interactive game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to guide the player (e.g., "too high" or "too low").

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors Game
A simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer. The game uses randomization for the computer's choice and evaluates the winner after each round.

### 4. Tic Tac Toe Game
A 2-player version of the popular Tic Tac Toe game implemented in the console. The game includes input validation, checking for a winner, and detecting a tie game.

### 5. Snake Game
A console-based snake game where the user controls the movement of a snake using the keyboard. The goal is to "eat" items that appear on the screen while avoiding running into the snake's own body.

### 6. Password Generator
A tool that generates strong, random passwords based on user-specified criteria (e.g., length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters).
